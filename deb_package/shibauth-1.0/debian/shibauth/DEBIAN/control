Description: PAM and NSS modules for authenticating with Shibboleth.
 Implementation of a PAM and a NSS module used to integrate Shibboleth between the
 authentication mechanisms for a Linux workstation.
 .
 The PAM module permits to authenticate over HTTP Basic Authentication.
 It uses libcurl to interact with the webserver and reads user session information
 from the web pages served after authentication.
 .
 The NSS module permits to obtain user information from a web page behind basic
 authentication. The page must expose two different contents depending on query string:
 - if ?passwd is provided the page must supply a file with the same structure of
   /etc/passwd and listing all users defined by the server
 - if ?group is provided the page must supply a file with the same structure of
   /etc/group and listing all user groups defined by the server
