# /etc/pam.d/check_user
# This file contains a possible configuration for the pam_http.so module which authenticates
# users using the HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism.
# This file is required for the check_user program to work correctly and so it is strongly
# suggested that it is copied in the /etc/pam.d folder and not only used as a source for
# modifications to others PAM configuration files.
